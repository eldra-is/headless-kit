# Themes

A theme is a Nuxt (or other framework) site whose pages are built from **blocks**: a `blocks/`
directory of `blocks/<apiId>/{block.json,Block.vue,mock.json}`, scanned at build time into a
manifest that Studio's page builder and Core's CMS schema both read. `block.json` declares a
block's fields (and optional migrations, slots); `Block.vue` renders it; `mock.json` supplies the
default data Studio shows before a page has real content. The scan output — the theme manifest,
`.eldra/manifest.json` — is what `eldra-theme deploy` uploads alongside the built static site; Core
ingests it to create or update the org's `block`-tagged CMS schemas. Git is version control for the
theme's code; the manifest is the sync channel, not the other way around.

## Package map

```
@eldrajs/theme-core        framework-free: bridge, stega, overlay runtime, layout, rich-text
                            positions, design tokens, image framing
  ├── @eldrajs/theme-vue          Vue 3 bindings (EldraBlockZone, EldraLayout, EldraRichText, useEldra)
  ├── @eldrajs/vite-plugin-theme  scans blocks/, validates, emits the manifest + virtual modules
  │     └── @eldrajs/theme-cli        eldra-theme: init/scaffold/validate/types/deploy
  └── @eldrajs/theme-nuxt       Nuxt module: wires vite-plugin-theme + theme-vue + the gateway
                                client + the Studio bridge into a Nuxt 4 site
```

`theme-core` carries all the logic and depends on nothing else in this repo. `theme-vue` and
`theme-nuxt` are thin framework bindings over it. `vite-plugin-theme` depends only on `theme-core`
(scanning and validation are framework-agnostic on purpose — a future non-Vue theme still gets them
for free). `theme-cli` depends on `theme-core` and `vite-plugin-theme` so `validate`/`types` reuse
the same scanner the build uses. `theme-nuxt` is the only package that depends on all three.

## The framework-free rule

`theme-core`, `vite-plugin-theme` and `theme-cli` (like `sdk` and `rich-text`) never import `vue`,
`nuxt`, `#app`, `#imports`, `@vue/*` or `nuxt/*`. `scripts/check-framework-free.mjs` enforces this
in `lint:check` and in CI — a framework import creeping into the framework-free layer is a design
error, not a lint nit, because it means the wrapper packages stopped being thin. `theme-vue` may
import only `vue` and `@eldrajs/theme-core`; `theme-nuxt` may import only Nuxt, `vue`, and the
three `@eldrajs/theme-*`/`vite-plugin-theme` packages.

Block and manifest **validation** lives in `@eldrajs/vite-plugin-theme` (`scanTheme`, used by the
Vite plugin on every build) and is re-exported through `@eldrajs/theme-cli`'s `validate`/`types`
commands, so `pnpm validate` and a CI build run the identical check without a CLI-specific
reimplementation. Both stay framework-agnostic: a non-Vue theme could call `scanTheme` directly.

## The Studio bridge

`@eldrajs/theme-core/bridge` is the postMessage protocol between a theme running in Studio's page
builder preview iframe and the Studio editor host. Messages come in two families: `theme:*` is what
the theme sends — `theme:ready`, `theme:route-changed`, `theme:block-clicked`,
`theme:rich-text-selection`, `theme:slots-rendered`, and so on — and `editor:*` is what Studio
sends back — `editor:hello`, `editor:init`, `editor:content-update`, `editor:design-tokens`,
`editor:select-block`, `editor:rich-text-editing`. Every message is wrapped in a versioned envelope
(`makeEnvelope`/`parseEnvelope`, `BRIDGE_VERSION`) that a theme on an older protocol version simply
ignores rather than misinterprets.

`@eldrajs/theme-core/overlay` builds on the bridge to drive in-place editing — the runtime that
turns bridge messages into DOM selection, rich-text input classification and structural drag
handling inside the preview iframe. `@eldrajs/theme-vue`'s `useEldraPreview`/`startEldraPreview` and
`@eldrajs/theme-nuxt`'s generated CSP `frame-ancestors` header are what actually wire a theme up to
receive it; a non-Vue binding would call the same bridge and overlay functions directly.

## Running the starter

```bash
pnpm --filter starter-nuxt dev
```

with `ELDRA_GATEWAY_URL` (the org's public CMS gateway) and `ELDRA_ORG_ID` set in the environment.
See [examples/starter-nuxt](../examples/starter-nuxt) for the full README, including blocks, slots,
build/deploy and CI wiring examples.
