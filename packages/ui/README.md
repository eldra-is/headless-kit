# `@eldrajs/ui`

Accessible Vue 3 core components for Eldra storefronts, themed through CSS design tokens.

Work in progress; see plan.

The components are built to `eldra-starter-spec/01-core-components.md` (WCAG 2.2 AA). Where this
package adds something the spec's property tables do not list, it is recorded below rather than
left for a reader to find.

## Deviations

Additions and departures from the design spec, and why.

- **`FormLayout` `statusMessage` and its status region.** The spec's Form layout States table ends
  with "Success: replace the form with a confirmation message (newsletter) or navigate (checkout),
  **and announce it in a polite live region**", and its acceptance criteria repeat it — but the
  properties table has nothing to announce _with_. So `FormLayout` always renders a visually hidden
  `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"` paragraph (`data-part="status"`), fed by a
  `statusMessage?: string` prop. Always in the DOM, because a live region added to the page at the
  same moment as its text is not reliably announced; empty until there is something to say. The
  _visible_ confirmation is still the page's job.
- **`FormLayout` `headingLevel`.** The spec calls the form's heading "h4 style", which names the
  type style (1.125rem, 600), not the outline level. The element is an `<h2>` by default — the
  level a form's own title takes under a page's `<h1>` — and `headingLevel?: 2 | 3 | 4` lets a form
  nested under a page's own `<h3>` avoid skipping a level. The type style never changes.
- **`FieldWrapper` `aria-describedby` order.** The spec writes
  `aria-describedby="<error-id> <help-id> <counter-id>"`; only the ids that actually render are
  emitted, so a field with no help never points at an element that is not there.
- **`FieldWrapper` slots are content.** `<template #error>` and `<template #help>` are richer ways
  of writing the `error` and `help` props (a message with a link in it, say), so a field with an
  `error` _slot_ is invalid and linked exactly as one with the prop is.
- **`Checkbox` `describedBy`.** The spec's Checkbox property table has no way to point at an
  error, but its Accessibility notes require one ("Required consent: `required`,
  `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby` pointing to an error that says what to do"). So
  `Checkbox` takes `describedBy?: string`, exactly as `Input` and `Textarea` do, and falls back to
  a `FieldWrapper`'s context when there is one.
- **`Checkbox`'s hint is part of the accessible name.** The spec's anatomy puts the hint "inside
  the label", and a `<label>`'s whole text is the control's name — so a box with a hint is
  announced as "Washed linen Pre-softened, will not shrink further". That is the spec's own
  structure, kept rather than swapped for an `aria-describedby` that would read the same words a
  beat later. It is also what makes the hint part of the click target.
- **`CheckboxGroup`'s error is the group's, not each option's.** `error` puts `aria-invalid="true"`
  and the `aria-describedby` link on the `<fieldset>`; the individual boxes keep their ordinary
  boundary. The spec's own 2px `danger` box is written against the **required consent** case (a
  single `Checkbox` with `invalid`), and repeating "invalid" on every one of five options is noise
  rather than information. This matches `FieldWrapper`'s `group` variant, which reads the same way.
- **A `CheckboxGroup` is not put inside a `FieldWrapper`.** It draws its own `<fieldset>` and
  `<legend>` — the spec's group anatomy — so a `FieldWrapper` with `group` set around it would nest
  a second fieldset and legend, and one without `group` would point a second `<label for>` at a
  box that already has one. Use the group on its own; use `FieldWrapper` for a single consent box.
- **`Button` touch growth is the primary action's.** "Only primary action buttons grow to
  `target-touch` (2.75rem)" below a 48rem container, so an `md` `primary` button grows and a
  secondary, outline, ghost or danger action beside it keeps the 2.5rem control height it shares
  with the inputs.
